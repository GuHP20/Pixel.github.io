<h2> A BIT ABOUT ME </h2>
  <p> My name is Owen. My interests include rocketry, space, science, and art. I have an interest in space because I feel that it is awesome that humans are exploring the most inhospitable, dangerous, yet beautiful places. I also take an interest in photography, although I am still learning! I enjoy science because it makes the world we live in so much easier to navigate, work in, and live in. I love to travel and explore. In addition to this, I enjoy camping and nature. 
I also take an interest in aircraft (mainly planes) </p>
